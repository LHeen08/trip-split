## Description
Have you ever planned a trip (or at least wanted to) with a group of people but didn't want to deal with splitting the costs based on each person's length of stay? Plannning with spreasheets can be tedious to split costs when not everyone may be able to stay the whole length of the trip.

With trip-split you can easily split trip costs with a large group of people and get equal payments per person with differing lengths of stay.
