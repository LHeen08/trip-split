# Description
Have you ever planned a trip (or at least wanted to) with a group of people but didn't want to deal with splitting the costs based on each person's length of stay? Plannning with spreasheets can be tedious to split costs when not everyone may be able to stay the whole length of the trip.

With trip-split you can easily split trip costs with a large group of people and get equal payments per person with differing lengths of stay.

# Installation
Installation is as easy as just cloning this repository to your local machine
```

Then open the index.html and start adding people to split your trip with!

## Export to csv
After adding people to the table you can easily export to a .csv file. With the download of the .csv file you can then import it into something like Google sheets and share the link so everyone in your group can easily see their payments!
